A diagram is achieved through the process of observation, reflection, understanding, documentation, iteration and experimentation. It is the synthesis of all of these attributes to make it meaningful and provide instruction. They appear deceptively simple but, as Johanna Drucker states, they are images that work hard!"

      "data": "So how does one arrive at a diagram? How does one simplify a complex procedure? How is it represented? How much information is required to communicate it? What graphic devices can be used or explored? How is movement translated into graphic form? Or duration? Or the stages of the activity? How does the audience interact with the diagram? What format or media best suits a diagram? Can a diagram work effectively in different cultures? Or without words? Can there be ambiguity within a diagram? These questions, and more, are to be explored, challenged and engaged with during the project."
